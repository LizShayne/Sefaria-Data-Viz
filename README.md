Sefaria-DataViz
===============

A small repository for the files and images created using the data from the Sefaria Project

Sefaria itself is an open source archive of Jewish texts that can be found at <a href="http://www.sefaria.org">Sefaria.org</a> and the Github repo is <a href="https://github.com/blockspeiser/Sefaria-Data">here</a>.

This repository contains two kinds of files. 

The first are the .csv files that contain all the data from my graphs in spreadsheet form. Ideally, these files are software agnostic and should allow you to import the data into the software of your choice.
If you are interested in the .gexf (Graph Exchange XML Format) files, they are hosted on my Google Drive account and can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6zAl46b8ElTZmZuWUhYMlY3dFE&usp=sharing">here</a>. 
The second are the image files I created in Gephi, some of which are also available on my blog. The higher res versions are here. The image files will be added over the course of the next few weeks. Don't be surprised if you don't see them yet.

The dates in the file names correspond to the dates on which I got the data from the Sefaria archive. The later the date, the larger the dataset.
5/28/14 has roughly 80,000 edges.
8/25/14 has roughly 150,000 edges.
9/22/14 has roughly 300,000 edges.
